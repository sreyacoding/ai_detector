AI vs Human Text Detection Model 

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that distinguishes between AI-generated text and human-written content. For example, the model can help detect whether a student or an LLM (Large Language Model), like ChatGPT, wrote an essay.

**Dataset:** 
We used the LLM-Detect AI Generated Text Dataset to train the model and ensure accurate classification.


**Model Training:**
The following models were trained and evaluated for this task:

- Logistic Regression: Used to classify text based on TF-IDF features.
- Random Forest: Utilized ensemble learning on TF-IDF features for better generalization.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): 
  - Achieved the highest F1 score among all models.
  - Selected as the final model for deployment due to superior performance.  
- BERT (Transformer Model): Fine-tuned on the dataset using the Transformers Library, but SVM outperformed it in terms of practical deployment.

**Tech Stack:**
- Scikit-learn: Used for training and evaluating the models.  
- Transformers Library: For experimentation with pre-trained models like BERT.  
- Streamlit: Built an interactive web app to allow users to input text and get predictions in real-time.


**Conclusion:**
The SVM model was chosen for deployment because it provided the best F1 score and overall performance. This project showcases how ML models can effectively identify text generated by AI systems, ensuring academic and professional integrity.
